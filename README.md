CS-360 Mobile Architect &amp; Programming

The goals of the application that I developed was to allow users to set a goal weight, track their daily weight progress, and notify them once their goal weight has been reached. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The screens and features that were necessary to support the user needs and produce a user-centered UI for my application were a login screen, a set "goal weight" screen, and a "track daily weight" screen. The features in/on and between these screens were an application database to store and log user data, as well as authenticate them, the ability to navigate through each screen, the ability to set and track the user's weight, and lastly the ability to receive SMS alerts once their goal weight was reached. 


The approach that I took during the process of coding my app was to use the .XML layout and drawable files for the visual appearance since they're much easier to design by using the attributes tab to make the visual design changes than to attempt code these properties manually within the .XML file. The strategy that I used was to plan first before coding, I wanted to have a full understanding of what my end goal was prior to starting to develop my code, otherwise later on some of my adjustments may not have been able to be made without having to make some serious changes or even starting over. 

I ensured that my code was functional was by debugging and running my code as frequently as possible to ensure that each change was reflected in my build as I intended it to.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, one place I had to innovate to overcome a challenge was to leverage Android Studio's resources to get the correct alignment, constraints, images, colors, buttons, and fonts the precise way that I wanted them to be. This is significantly much more difficult to do with the XML code alone.


The specific component of my mobile app where I was particularly successful in demonstrating my knowledge, skills, and experience was throughout the design of each screen and the workflow between them. I took a strong approach to ensuring that my app felt "real" and "natural", and could be potentially an actual app people could use one day, not just for a school project.
